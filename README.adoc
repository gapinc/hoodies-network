:toc:
:source-highlighter: highlightjs

== Introduction

Hoodies-Network is a modern, type-safe and high-performance Android HTTP library.
Though its feature set has expanded over time to match and sometimes exceed other libraries with respect to performance.
It was originally designed to make network calls in Gapâ€™s Instant Apps.

* Is designed using a philosophy of simple and clean architecture
* Offers a highly competitive feature set while providing a smaller binary size
* Is Kotlin-native

== Features

* URL parameter replacement and query parameter support
* Object conversion to request body (e.g., JSON, protocol buffers)
* Object conversion from response body (e.g., JSON, protocol buffers, images)
* Custom header support
* Multiple and multipart file upload
* Support for POST, GET, PATCH, PUT, and DELETE methods
* Success and failure callbacks
* Request, error, network, response, request body encryption, and response body decryption interceptors
* Automatic retry on failure
* Use of SSLSocketFactory
* Advanced mock web server
* Advanced optionally encrypted cache system
* Built-in cookie handling including encrypted persistent local storage

== Usage Guide

=== Getting Started

. Integrate this library as a dependency in your project:
.. Clone the project and publish it to your local Maven repository:
... (In Android Studio top menu) Build -> Clean Build
... *Build* -> *Make Module 'Hoodies-Network.Hoodies-Network'*
... *Gradle* -> *Tasks* -> *publishing* -> *publishAarPublicationToMavenLocal*
.. Use Gradle to add it as a dependency in your project: 
... `implementation "com.gap.androidlibraries:hoodies-networkandroid:latest"`
. Build your HttpClient:

[source,kotlin]
----
val defaultHeaders = hashMapOf(
        CONTENT_TYPE_KEY to APPLICATION_JSON, MULTIDB_ENABLED to MULTIDB_ENABLED_VALUE,
        CLIENT_ID to CLIENT_ID_VALUE,
        CLIENT_OS to CLIENT_OS_VALUE
    )

val client = HoodiesNetworkClient.Builder()
    .baseUrl(baseUrl)
    .addHeaders(defaultHeaders)
    .addInterceptor(sessionInterceptor)
    .retryOnConnectionFailure(true, HoodiesNetworkClient.RetryCount.RETRY_MAX)
    .build()
----

=== Using Interceptors

Optionally, you can create an `Interceptor` Class which inherits from `com.gap.network.interceptor.Interceptor`.
`Interceptors` allow you read/modify all properties (headers, body, etc.) of requests and responses before they are executed/delivered.

`CancellableMutableRequests` can be cancelled by calling `cancellableMutableRequest.cancelRequest(Success(object to return))` or `cancellableMutableRequest.cancelRequest(Failure(message, code, throwable))` - based on your use case.

`RetryableCancellableMutableRequests` can be cancelled as well as retried. 
If the request has its body or headers changed, the retry attempt will execute the request with the changes intact.

[source,kotlin]
----
class SessionInterceptor(context: Context) : Interceptor(context) {

    override fun interceptNetwork(isOnline: Boolean, cancellableMutableRequest: CancellableMutableRequest) {
	//First thing that is called before the request is made
	//Here, you can define what happens if the device knows that it is offline
	//For example:
        //If you don't want the request to be executed if there is no network connection:
	if (!isOnline) { cancellableMutableRequest.cancelRequest(Failure(HoodiesNetworkError("No connection!", 0, SocketTimeoutException("No connection!")))) }
    }

    override fun interceptRequest(identifier: String, cancellableMutableRequest: CancellableMutableRequest) {
        //Second thing that is called before the request is made
	//Here, you can define some universal behaviors for all network requests
	//For example:
	//Append an Authorization header
	val headers = cancellableMutableRequest.request.getHeaders().toMutableMap()        	
	headers["Authorization"] = "Something"
        cancellableMutableRequest.request.setRequestHeaders(headers)
    }

    override fun interceptError(error: HoodiesNetworkError, retryableCancellableMutableRequest: RetryableCancellableMutableRequest, autoRetryAttempts: Int) {
        //This is invoked before the failure callback is called
	//Here, you can define some universal behaviors for error handling
	//For example:
	//You can retry the request if it fails because of expired authorization data
	if (error.code == 403) {
		val headers = retryableCancellableMutableRequest.request.getHeaders().toMutableMap()        	
		headers["Authorization"] = getNewAuthorization()
        	retryableCancellableMutableRequest.request.setRequestHeaders(headers)
	
	  	retryableCancellableMutableRequest.retryRequest()
	}
    }

    override fun interceptResponse(result: Result<*, HoodiesNetworkError>, request: Request<Any>?) {
        //This is invoked upon the successful completion of a request
	//Here, you can define some universal behaviors for all responses
    }
}
----

=== Using Automatic Retry

If a request fails due to a `SocketTimeoutException` or `IOException`, Hoodies-Network can automatically retry the request a specific number of times.

Retry is configured in the `HoodiesNetworkClient.Builder()` with the `.retryOnConnectionFailure(true, HoodiesNetworkClient.RetryCount.RETRY_MAX)` method.

The following options are available:

* `HoodiesNetworkClient.RetryCount.RETRY_NEVER`
* `HoodiesNetworkClient.RetryCount.RETRY_ONCE`
* `HoodiesNetworkClient.RetryCount.RETRY_TWICE`
* `HoodiesNetworkClient.RetryCount.RETRY_THRICE`
* `HoodiesNetworkClient.RetryCount.RETRY_MAX`

=== Configuring Timeouts

* Connect timeout can be configured using `HttpClientConfig.setConnectTimeOut(Duration.ofSeconds(seconds))`
* Read timeout can be configured using `HttpClientConfig.setReadTimeOut(Duration.ofSeconds(seconds))`
* Setting the duration to 0 will make the timeout infinite
* Changes apply to all `HttpClients`
* Defaults can be restored using `HttpClientConfig.setFactoryDefaultConfiguration()`

=== Handling Cookies

By default, all cookies are ignored.
Cookie retention and manipulation can be performed as follows:

. Pass a `CookieJar` to the `.enableCookiesWithCookieJar()` method of the `HoodiesNetworkClient.Builder()`:
.. (For most use-cases) Use the `CookieJar()`
.. (If cookies must persist across app launches) Use the `PersistentCookieJar("myPersistentCookieJar", context)` - Cookies are securely encrypted while in storage
. Manipulate the contents of the `CookieJar` using the following methods:
.. `getCookiesForHost(host: URI) : List<HttpCookie>` gets all the cookies for a specified host
.. `getAllCookies() : List<HttpCookie>` gets all the cookies stored in the `CookieJar`
.. `getAllHosts() : List<URI>` gets a list of all hosts that have stored cookies in the `CookieJar`
.. `setCookiesForHost(host: URI, cookies: List<HttpCookie>)` overwrites all the cookies for the specified host with those in the passed list 
.. `addCookieForHost(host: URI, cookie: HttpCookie)` adds the passed cookie for the specified host 
.. `removeAllCookies()` deleted all cookies in the `CookieJar`

=== Using the Cache

By default, no data is cached.
Caching can be configured and enabled as follows:

. Create a `CacheEnabled` object 
.. If the data in the cache needs to be encrypted, set `encryptionEnabled = true`
.. Decide what the stale data threshold should be and set it: `staleDataThreshold = Duration.ofSeconds(60)`
.. Instantiate the object: `val cacheConfiguration = CacheEnabled(encryptionEnabled = true, staleDataThreshold = Duration.ofSeconds(60), context)`
. Pass the `CacheEnabled` object to the `cacheConfiguration` parameter when making a network request:

[source,kotlin]
----
return@withContext client.getUrlQueryParam<LocationAttribute>(
        queryParams = queryParams,
        api = pathParams,
        cacheConfiguration = cacheConfiguration
    )
----

=== Using Encryption/Decryption Interceptors

Encryption/decryption of the request and response bodies can be implemented by passing an `EncryptionDecryptionInterceptor` to the `.addEncryptionDecryptionInterceptor(encDecInterceptor)` method of the `HoodiesNetworkClient.Builder()`.

[source,kotlin]
----
val encDecInterceptor = EncDecInterceptor(this.context)

class EncDecInterceptor(override val context: Context) : EncryptionDecryptionInterceptor {

    override fun decryptResponse(response: ByteArray): ByteArray {
        // add your decryption logic here
        return  ByteArray(1)
    }

    override fun encryptAdditionalHeaders(additionalHeaderValue: ByteArray): ByteArray {
        // add your encryption logic here
        return  ByteArray(1)
    }

    override fun encryptRequest(requestBodyOrUrlQueryParamKeyValue: ByteArray): ByteArray {
        // add your encryption logic here
        return  ByteArray(1)
    }
}
----

=== Using the MockWebServer

The MockWebServer can replicate your API endpoints for unit testing purposes.

. Create a `MockWebServerManager.Builder()` and set the port: `val serverBuilder = MockWebServerManager.Builder().usePort(5000)`
. Mock your API endpoints (For simple use-cases) Using the MockServerMaker DSL:
+
[source,kotlin]
----
//Make request body
val body = JSONObject()
body.put("name", "test_1")
body.put("salary", "1234")
body.put("age", "123")

//Make request headers
val reqHeaders: MutableMap<String, String> = HashMap()
reqHeaders["key"] = "value"

//Mock response
val response = "{\"status\":\"success\",\"data\":{\"name\":\"test_1\",\"salary\":\"1234\",\"age\":\"123\",\"id\":9221},\"message\":\"Successfully! Record has been added.\"}"

//Set up MockWebServer builder with port
val serverBuilder = MockWebServerManager.Builder().usePort(5000)

//Set up handler on MockWebServer to accept the request body and headers from above
MockServerMaker.Builder()
    .acceptMethod(HoodiesNetworkClient.HttpMethod.POST)
    .expect(body) //Can also be a HashMap<String, String> to validate URL-encoded params
    .expectHeaders(reqHeaders)
    .returnThisJsonIfInputMatches(JSONObject(response))
    .applyToMockWebServerBuilder("/test", serverBuilder)
---- 
.(For advanced behavior) By making a `WebServerHandler()` for your endpoint:
+
[source,kotlin]
----
val handler = object : WebServerHandler() {
    override fun handleRequest(call: HttpCall) {
        when (method) {
            //KTor-like syntax
            get {
                val delayLength = call.httpExchange.requestURI.toString().split("/").last()
                Thread.sleep(delayLength.toLong() * 1000L)
                call.respond(200, "{\"delay\":\"$delayLength\"}")
            }
            post {
                val delayLength = call.httpExchange.requestURI.toString().split("/").last()
                Thread.sleep(delayLength.toLong() * 1000L)
                call.respond(200, "{\"delay\":\"$delayLength\"}")
            }
        }
    }
}

serverBuilder.addContext("/echodelay", handler)
---- 
. Start the MockWebServer: `val server = serverBuilder.start()`
. Run your tests
. Stop the MockWebServer: `server.stop()`
